# To test

The push_swap_test.sh or push_swap_test_linux.sh file and the checker_mac or checker_linux should be in the same directory where is the push_swap program. Once the terminal is open and we are in the project directory we executed this command:

If you don't have MacOS, instead of running push_swap_test.sh, execute push_swap_test_linux.sh

>
bash push_swap_test.sh

We also can add two arguments that will be the times that we executed the 100 and 500 tests. If you don't put arguments, it will execute 200 for each test by default.

>
bash push_swap_test.sh 250 250.
